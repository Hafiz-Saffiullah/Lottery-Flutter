# Lottery-Flutter
The Lottery App is a simple Flutter application that simulates a lottery draw. When the user taps the "Refresh" floating action button, a random number between 0 and 5 (inclusive) is generated, representing the user's lottery number. If the user's number matches the winning number (which is 4 in this case), they win the lottery; otherwise, they are encouraged to try again.
